# Selectoplasm

Selectoplasm is a CSS design experience made for developers. It runs as a dev dependency in your project and allows you to style your app in runtime, in the browser. It provides the following features:

- use your preferred set of utility classes during the design process, but ship without them.
- keep your CSS entirely separate from your application's html and javascript
- create reusable components with default settings that can be customised in any app you drop them in
- BYO design system or generate one dynamically with a powerful plugin system
- create your own **zero-build** plugins using plain html, css and javascript
- an unbelievably simple developer experience from beginning to end
