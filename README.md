Selectoplasm currently works with Bun, and with Vite if the projects were created with `npm create vite`. It might work on other vite-based projects too, but it might not. Astro for instance has an issue and I haven't made a proper integration yet.

There's a manual setup page in the docs, it's mostly just setting up endpoints for the app to use.

Hit me up on Discord or post on reddit if you have questions, happy to help!
